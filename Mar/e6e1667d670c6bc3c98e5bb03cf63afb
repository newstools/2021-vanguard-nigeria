Delivering judgment, Chief Ademola Odunade, the President of the court, dissolved the marriage in the interest of peace. Odunade awarded custody of the two children Okeowo. The arbitrator ordered Lateef to pay N10,000 as child support. Testfying, Okeowo said: ”my lord, things are not going on well. He requests for unsual and personal things from me”.
