Roskomnadzor threatened to block the service completely, adding that there were more than 3,000 posts containing illegal content on it as of Wednesday.

Twitter did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment. Wednesday’s move comes amid mounting efforts by Moscow to exert greater influence over U.S. social media platforms and frustrations over what authorities say is their failure to follow Russian laws.
