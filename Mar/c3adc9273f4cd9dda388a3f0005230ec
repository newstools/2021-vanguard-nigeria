Nile University of Nigeria’s robust School of Postgraduate Studies, through its programs, provides professionals with the opportunity to expand their capabilities and improve their career prospects. Nile University offers 47 postgraduate degree programs (PGD, M.A., M.Sc., MPhil, PhD, MBA) across five faculties—College of Health Sciences, Engineering, Natural & Applied Sciences, Management Sciences, and Arts & Social Sciences. Pursuing a Postgraduate degree at Nile University provides several benefits for students. For starters, it offers them an opportunity to upskill and improve their employability (for students seeking employment) or facilitate career advancement (for working students). Nile’s postgraduate students are taught by highly experienced lecturers—such as Prof. Dilli Dogo, a nationally renowned surgeon— who boast significant international experience and the requisite industry expertise to equip students to be competitive in the labor market. Additionally, Nile University’s School of Postgraduate Studies offers professionals a unique advantage of working and studying full-time simultaneously, thanks to its flexible class scheduling. The University’s postgraduate classes hold in the evenings on weekdays and on weekends, ensuring that working students can continue to pursue their academic goals without sacrificing their professional objectives. Speaking on the convenience provided by the University’s flexible scheduling to professionals, Faith Obot, a Project Administrative Assistant at Rhino Coating and Lining International (Nigeria Office), who is currently pursuing her Master’s degree in International Relations and Diplomacy at Nile University stated: “The fact that Nile University holds its postgraduate classes in the evenings was one of the main reasons I chose to study here. Having such a convenient class schedule has made it possible for me to further my education without needing to quit my job or request for an extended leave.” Another benefit of getting a postgraduate degree at Nile University is the networking opportunities it offers students. The university’s postgraduate students comprise professionals from various high-profile organizations, successful entrepreneurs, to name a few. This affords students the chance to enhance their professional network and, potentially, access lucrative job and business opportunities. Nile University also offers attractive tuition-based incentives for working students to encourage group enrolment. Commenting on the incentive, Nile University’s Vice-Chancellor, Prof. Osman Nuri Aras, stated: “One of our primary aims, at Nile University, is to encourage employees to further their studies in order to improve their career prospects and enhance organizational capacity. We realized that there are many workers that want to upskill by furthering their education but are discouraged from doing so due to the financial investment required. By offering such individuals our attractive tuition-based incentives, we hoped to eliminate this obstacle to capacity building.” Admission is ongoing for the 2020/2021 academic session at Nile University of Nigeria.
