Having to go on a ‘honeymoon’ in the movie with Yvonne Jegede struck a chord in me, it brought back memories. I practically forgot I was acting at some point in time, I got into character and that was it! Few days after the shoot, I had to deliberately snap out of the role in my head, that was how engaging the role was for me”. Deyemi Okanlawon concluded his thoughts by saying ‘’I hope you guys like the movie as we put our blood and sweat just so people can identify with the storyline, when the movie gets to the cinema in April, you guys would appreciate this amazing work of art from the cast and crew of this movie’’. The movie was shot at the Kalakuta Museum in Lagos.
