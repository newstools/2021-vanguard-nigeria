In his first major speech on transatlantic relations since the inauguration of President Joe Biden in January, Maas offered the US a “New Deal,” including a joint fight for democracy, more German responsibility in resolving conflicts in and around Europe and a joint strategy towards China and Russia. “Germany is at your side,” Maas said at an online event organized by the US Brookings Institution. He supported a further increase in German defence spending – a long-standing point of tension with Trump – and spoke in favour of negotiations on sector-specific trade agreements and the revival of cooperation on climate protection. Biden made fighting climate change a central pillar of his campaign for the White House and has put the US back in the Paris climate agreement, which Trump rejected. Brookings has set up a new chair for Germany and transatlantic relations with funds from donors including 2 million euros (2.4 million dollars) from the German government.
