We also believe that this further underscores that we believe in this vaccine and it is important as we have been advised by specialists worldwide that the vaccine is safe; the vaccines have been shown to reduce the severity of this disease. “However, we’ve been warned that the full benefit of the vaccine can only be enjoyed when you’ve taken the second dosage, even after this first dose, you must continue to use your facemask and continue to social distance, it is not a license to begin to move about without your facemask. Speaking after taking his jab, former governor, Chief Olusegun Osoba said he took it upon himself to come for the vaccination to encourage others not to hesitate to take the vaccine. “There is absolutely no risk or danger in taking the COVID-19 vaccine. I recommend the vaccine to everyone in the state. If I have taken the vaccine at the age of 82, there is no need for anyone to fear. I am confident the vaccine wouldn’t harm anyone”, he assured. Chief Osoba while congratulating the governor and the state government for being the first state to receive the COVID-19 vaccine, said that he was at the Governor’s office to show example and leadership. “I want to congratulate the governor and government of Ogun State for being the first state to receive this vaccine and I have come to show an example, leadership and to convince our people in Ogun State that the vaccine is safe and that they should ignore many of the misinformation that is going on the internet about the risk in taking this vaccine,” he said.
