While the entertainment industry is perceived by many as being injurious to lasting marital unions, some actresses are obviously swimming in it and enjoying the best of both worlds: limelight and nuptial bliss. One of such acts is Nollywood’s Chioma Toplis, who came to national consciousness in the movie, ‘Stolen Bible’, which also starred Kate Henshaw. According to her, in her 25 years of marriage, “It is wrong to think that marriages fail because one is in this career or that job. I hear a lot of people saying actresses do not do well in marriage and I wonder what side of the bed they always wake up from. It cuts across careers. From teaching, banking, entertainment to politics, one gets couples who are sad and some who are very happy.
