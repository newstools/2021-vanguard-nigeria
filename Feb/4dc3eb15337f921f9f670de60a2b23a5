Lucky Irabor, has urged telecommunications service providers in Nigeria to support the efforts by the military and other security agencies to address insecurity across the country apprehend perpetrators of crimes across the country. Irabor made the call when he received the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the Mobile Telecom Network (MTN) Nigeria, Mr Karl Toriola, who was on a familiarisation visit to the Defence Headquarters on Friday in Abuja. The Acting Director, Defence Information, Brig.-Gen. Onyema Nwachukwu, disclosed this in a statement in Abuja. The CDS said that communication was part of the essential mechanism that could be used by the armed forces and other security agencies to track down perpetrators of criminalities and nefarious activities in the country. He gave assurance that the Defence Headquarters would welcome and sustain any fruitful engagement and partnership with all stakeholders, including service providers to build a peaceful environment for economic activities to thrive. Irabor commended MTN for playing invaluable roles in matters of communication in Nigeria, adding that the military and other security agencies leverage on it to boost their operations.
