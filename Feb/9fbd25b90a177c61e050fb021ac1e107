Ologunmeta, who resides at No. 17, Bale St., Ikorodu Road, Maryland, Lagos is facing a two-count charge of fraud and stealing. He, however, pleaded not guilty. The prosecutor, ASP Benson Emuerhi, told the court that the defendant committed the offences in November 2020 at his residence. Emuerhi said that the defendant collected the N2 million from the complainant, Mrs Aishat Rasak, that he would procure a Solomon Islands visa for her, but failed to do so.
