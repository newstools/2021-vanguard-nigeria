Chief Registrar Anne Amadi told a judicial forum for station heads in Kisumu, western Kenya, that 30 judicial staff were dismissed three years ago, 72 two years ago and 72 last year. She said the Judiciary is concerned about the high number of staff engaging in malpractices resulting to such dismissals. Amadi lamented that the sacked staff have left a big gap in the Judiciary leading to strained service delivery.
