Samsix’s first attempt at music came when he was 11 years old in the USA when he participated in a singing competition sponsored by a radio station and Disney World and came  second. Though, it was not a big one but he took the positivism from the experience which further propelled him to practice more, discovered his sound and pushed in others to perfect his craft. His new song” Do For Luv” appears to be his message for music lovers as he prepares to get them in the mood with his musical journey for the year. With a number of songs to his name, Samsix is not slowing down on his bid to put his name on the minds of many people and register his songs on their lips. Do For Luv, which was produced by popular hit maker, Snowpondeck is coming on the heels of his fast rising profile as he keeps giving fans glimpses of what to expect from him.

I understand the competition is rife but I am ready for whatever the game brings”, he said.
