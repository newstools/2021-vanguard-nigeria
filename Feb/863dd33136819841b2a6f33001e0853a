The country’s educational sector has been among the industries most affected by the virus as illustrated by the various instances of partial and total school closures which have significantly disrupted the academic calendars of the different levels of education nationwide. However, despite the uncertainties created by COVID-19 in the academic world, particularly at the tertiary level, some universities have managed to avoid interruptions to their academic activities, thanks to a combination of excellent IT infrastructure, agility, and astute strategic planning. Nile University of Nigeria is a good case in point. When the prospect of a complete nationwide lockdown loomed in the early part of March 2020, the Nile University management swiftly sprung into action, implementing online learning systems that would enable the institution to continue delivering instruction to students remotely should traditional/classroom learning be halted. Thus, when the Federal Government of Nigeria ordered the closure of schools on March 20, 2020, Nile University was prepared to transition to online learning. This display of effective futuristic planning ensured that the University was able to complete the 2019/2020 academic session on schedule. Nile University’s ability to ensure education continuity for its students amid the COVID-19 crisis also owed to its emphasis on the integration of technology in learning. Since the University’s establishment in 2009, it has constantly viewed digital infrastructure as indispensable tools to support student learning. This belief prompted the institution to invest heavily on state-of-the-art IT infrastructure, equipping itself with the capability to not only provide its students with 21st century industry-relevant education but also to adapt to and provide uninterrupted services to its students in a variety of situations, such as the ongoing COVID-19 crisis. Nile’s digital and online learning capability has been further enhanced by its recent membership of the Honoris United Universities network, the largest pan-African private higher education network that boasts significant expertise in distance learning. The University’s ingenuity was, again, brought to the fore during the reopening of schools in the latter months of 2020. Prior to the re-opening, Nile University was proactive in adopting a blended learning system that combined both physical and online learning. To ensure the safety of its student group that was scheduled to resume classroom learning, the University implemented several safety measures on campus, including mandatory temperature checks and hand disinfection at all building entrances, among others. These efforts ensured that Nile University was able to continue to provide safe, uninterrupted education to its students during the transition from complete online learning to partial physical learning. Another major benefit of the institution’s decision to utilize a blended learning system for the 2020/2021 academic session was the option it afforded Nile of a seamless transition back to online learning should the COVID19 situation deteriorate—an outcome that came to fruition in December 2020, when the government ordered all schools to discontinue their physical academic activities following the second wave of the pandemic. Through its ability to ensure education continuity despite COVID19, Nile University has provided its students with a rare sense of stability in otherwise uncertain times. Admission is ongoing for the 2020/2021 academic session at Nile University of Nigeria. Interested students can apply online by visiting Nile University’s online application page at application.nileuniversity.edu.ng —the institution’s online application process is completely free.
