In a statement by the Minister of Health, Dr. Osagie Enahire, and UN Resident Coordinator, Mr. Edward Kallon, after a strategic meeting on national vaccine deployment plans, they promised to “use all platforms, including the expansion of the One UN Basket Fund for COVID-19 as well as bilateral and multilateral and private sector engagements, to ensure vaccine security and equitable access for all Nigerians”. They hailed the development and approval of safe and effective vaccines less than a year after the emergence of a new virus as a stunning scientific achievement, and a much-needed source of hope. They jointly expressed their resolve to ensure that Nigeria gets the most potent and efficacious vaccines. The Government and UN also called on all stakeholders in the country to join ongoing efforts to boost public acceptance and confidence in COVID-19 vaccine safety even as the country prepares to receive the much-awaited first batch of vaccines through the WHO-led COVAX facility. They stressed the need to step-up high-level advocacy, strengthen leadership and coordination at the highest Federal and State level, and accelerate preparedness for effective and efficient vaccine delivery, including provisions to reach inaccessible areas. Further, Dr Ehanire noted that vaccine shortages, even for a short period of time, might increase the risk of vaccine-preventable diseases, including COVID-19, to surge and cause morbidity and mortality among vulnerable persons.
