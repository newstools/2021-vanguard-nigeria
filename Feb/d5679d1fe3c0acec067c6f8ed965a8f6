Since then, it has become a pivotal part of many different subcultures worldwide, especially in minority and Black communities. Sneakers are still on the rise and are one of the most stylish options you can find for everyday wear. The sneakers market was worth about $100 billion as of 2019, and that number is only expected to grow. Estimates show that the resale market alone could reach $30 billion by 2030. This is due to the high investment that sneaker enthusiasts have in the culture. The average sneakerhead owns approximately 17 pairs of sneakers. That’s an impressive number, given that many of them are expensive, and collectible pairs can be difficult to find. While some people hide their sneakers on a display rack in their homes, it’s becoming much more popular to incorporate them into everyday wear. This is especially true as the fashion industry evolves and has begun marketing colorful, exciting sneakers to attract women. Just because sneakers were in mint condition when you got them doesn’t mean you can’t wear them and show them off to people on the street. As celebrities and influencers continue to become invested in the sneaker trend, more and more people from younger generations will become invested in having their own collection of sneakers.
