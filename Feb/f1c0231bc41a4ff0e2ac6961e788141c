The Chief Magistrate, P.E. Nwaka, gave the remand order at a Magistrates’ Court in Yaba, Lagos on Wednesday. Yussuf is facing a count charge of murder, but his plea was not taken by the court. Nwaka, ordered that the defendant be kept at the Ikoyi Custodial Center, pending legal advice from the Lagos State Directorate of Public Prosecution (DPP). He adjourned the case until February 23. Earlier, the Prosecutor, ASP Thomas Nurudeen, told the court that the defendant committed the offence on Dec. 27, 2020, at Ajanaku lagoon in Badagry, near Lagos. According to him, the defendant’s wife had dropped their ailing six weeks old baby with him to look after, so that she could do her business. He said that the defendant had taken the baby and his first son to Ajanaku lagoon and threw her into the lagoon in the presence of his son who tried to stop him.
