The medical doctors also called for improved testing and treatment of COVID-19 positive health care workers in the police medical services. Speaking during an advocacy visit by the NMA State Officers Committee to the Lagos State Commissioner of Police, CP, Hakeem Odumosu, the Chairman, Dr Adetunji Adenekan said the upward review of the police medical services was in the best interest of the workforce. Stressing that security was important as health, he highlighted other concerns to include; tackling medical quackery and drug counterfeiting, police harassment of doctors in the line of duty, and the need for the officers to protect healthcare workers from patients’ assault. Continuing, Adenekan noted: “The year 2021 gives more opportunities for more collaborations, advocacy and building strong partnerships. He said the members of NMA State Officers Committee will collaborate with the Lagos State Police to achieve all that they advocated for.” He also commended the CP on his support and the improvement in the state Police Medical Services. Adenekan further commiserated with him on the loss of his staff during the #ENDSARS protest, stating that the NMA was actively and physically represented in Lagos University Teaching Hospital, LASUTH, to save the lives of as many officers as the conditions could permit. In his response, the CP Hakeem Odumosu appreciated the visit, adding that, their call to serve humanity was the same as the doctors but through different routes/dimensions all in the bid to bring succour and wellbeing to the society. While pledging that all their requests would be granted, he said: ”As long as we have opened the communication link, the NMA will always be contacted for any case of alleged misconduct etc that involves the doctors and the police as some officers can get overzealous times. “The Police will always provide security when needed for our programs and activities, but we must give at least 24 hours notice.” He, however, noted that there is no group without a “black sheep” adding that, while some officers of the force may overdo things, which will be properly addressed, mutual respect must be embraced at all times.” In Attendance were; DCP Ahmed Kotangora.(DCP Operations), DCP Adegoke (DCP Panti), DCP Bassey Ewah (DCP Admin &  Finance), ACP Jide Ola Agboola (ACP Finance), Eight (8)Area Commanders(including Ikeja, Mushin, Surulere, Ikorodu etc), CSP Olumuyiwa Adejobi (Force PRO) and CSP Dr Bose Salami (Head Police Medicals Services & NMA Lagos Chairman Committee on Police Affairs) while NMA team includes; Dr Joy Agbara-Chionuma (VC2) , Dr Ime Okon (Secretary), Dr Adeola Badmus( Publicity Secretary), Dr Obatomi Alalade (Financial Secretary), Dr Olawale Peters (Social Secretary), Dr Fadeelat Iyanda (Internal Auditor), Dr Olawale Oladubu (Ass Secretary), Dr Feyisike Dauda( Ass Secretary), Dr Makinde Akinlembola (AGPMPN Chairman),  Rtd CP Dr Efunsola Sowemimo (Chairman Anti-quackery committee), Dr Olusanjo Moses (Chairman House of Assembly Liaison) and Mr Abiodun Akinsanya (NMA Lead Admin Officer).
