Already, the indigenes of the community have fled the community to neighbouring villages and elsewhere for fear of reprisal attack on the community by the military.

He was said to have been killed in the forest between the boundary of Apoi and Azuzuama communities, where there is a pipeline, the assailants reportedly carted away with his AK 47 rifle, before community folks could get to the spot.

These people(perpetrators) are not from Apoi, something like this has never happened, they are not from our community and their identity is still unknown.
