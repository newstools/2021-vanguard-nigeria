The Naira appreciated in the Investors and Exporters (I&E) window by 3.9 percent in January as  the nation’s external reserves recorded the first monthly increase of   $1.11 billion during the month, courtesy of   the steady upward trend in crude oil price since December. Data from the CBN showed that the external reserves rose to $36.395 billion Wednesday January 27th from $35.373 on December 31st last year. This translates to 3.1 or $1.11 billion monthly increase. The monthly increase, the first since May last year, follows an upward trend in the reserves since December 18th, when it recorded the first daily gain to $34.841 billion, after a nine week decline which commenced   from $35.672 billion in October. The steady increase in reserves since December 18th is driven by the rally in the price of crude oil, which accounts for 90 percent of the nation’s dollar earnings. After falling below $25 per barrel in April, due to the severe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic,   crude oil prices went through a bumpy recovery which accelerated in December. For example, the price of Nigeria’s Bonny Light crude oil rose steadily to $55.75 per barrel on Wednesday January 27th   from $46.67 per barrel on November 30th, indicating a 19.4 percent increase during the eight   weeks period. Reflecting the increased dollar earnings, the naira appreciated in the Investors and Exporters (I&E) window by 3.9 percent or N15.87   to N394.13 per dollar in January from N410 per dollar at the end of December.
