He spoke in reaction to the alleged attack on him, while on his way for a scheduled meeting at an undisclosed place. Igboho, who was allegedly attacked at Guru Maraj’s area in Ibadan, said: “I am not running from anybody. Nobody can intimidate me. I have returned to my house in Ibadan.” “I can only subject myself to arrest after the government must have arrested the bandits terrorising the country. The government should go after those bandits first.” He lamented that he was disappointed that he was attacked without committing any offence by men of DSS who on the instruction of unknown authorities, attempted to prevent him to move around in Ibadan and beyond. He said, despite their effrontery to stop him, he had managed to have his way to point of his scheduled meeting.
