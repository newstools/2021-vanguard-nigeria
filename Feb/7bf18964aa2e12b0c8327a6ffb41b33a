He stated this while on a condolence visit over the demise of former Military Governor of the State, Air Comdr. Idongesit Nkanga (rtd.), former Nigeria’s Chief of Air State, Air Marshall Nsikak Eduok and the state Chairman of the PDP, Obong Udo Ekpenyong last Sunday. He was in the company of his Zamfara State counterpart, Governor Bello Mohammed Mutwalle. According to him, Governor Udom Emmanuel has been able to re-establish peace and harmonious co-existence in Akwa Ibom State and the State has been rid of cult activities, allowing people to go about their lawful businesses freely. “I commend Governor Udom for that, of course with the infrastructural development in the state it is really clear the imprints are all over the place people are happy and I believe that he has done a lot of giant strides in turning around Akwa Ibom we commend him and we are proud of him. He is a voice in this country and we expected nothing less from him. He is a man for the future”. Also speaking, the Zamfara State governor, Dr Bello Mohammed Mutwalle, said because of Governor Emmanuel’s leadership style, peace and development in the state have continued uninterrupted, something he noted others should learn from. Governor Mutwall also condoled with the people and government and people of the state, with whom he said, his people have become one family having joined the PDP for the first time. He said he was visiting Akwa Ibom state for the first time, admired the peaceful ambience of the state and called for prayers for the peace of all parts of the country, urging all Nigerians to unite against the challenges in some parts of the country occasioned by banditry and other forms of criminality. “Let us put out hands together. Let us forget all our differences. Let us be preaching peace wherever we find ourselves. We have to remain together. God did not make mistake in bringing all of us in one basket as Nigeria. Let’s try to protect our country”, the Zamfara Governor said. Responding, the Akwa Ibom State Governor, Mr Udom Emmanuel, thanked the duo for identifying with him and the people of the state in the season of grief, describing their visit and kind words as an expression of love which, he added, cannot be taken for granted. He expressed the sympathy of his government to the Government and people of Sokoto state over the recent inferno in the Shehu Shagari Modern Market, popularly called New Market, in the State, which led to the wanton loss of lives and properties. He, however, lauded Tambuwal’s peaceful disposition and wide range of experience in leadership. These, he said, were responsible for the coordination and peace in the PDP Governors Forum under his leadership. He urged his Sokoto and Zamfara counterparts to pray for peace in the various states of the federation facing various degrees of violent crimes, particularly for Zamfara which, he said, was richly endowed with natural resources that could not be converted to benefit the common man due to distractions and other circumstances militating against good governance. “Let me on behalf of the government and the good people of Akwa Ibom State share our sympathy on the recent happenings in the two States. The inferno at the market in Sokoto was something that made us devastated at a time we are looking for infrastructure. I also extend my sympathy to my brother Governor in Zamfara. “I really sympathize with you over the level of criminality and banditry you have had to battle with every day because if you compare the challenges with the resources that all of us have, it’s a far cry, but I thank God for the grace”, Governor Emmanuel stated. “Zamfara has a whole lot of mineral resources. We hope as PDP will come into the centre in 2023 we should be able to harness all the resources for the benefit of the common man and for the people to have peace and prosperity in their daily lives” he added.
