The Executive Secretary of NCDMB, Engr.

Speaking during the signing, the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Chief Timipre Sylva said the project was part of the strategic efforts to maximize value and monetize the country’s vast gas endowments. “President Muhammed Buhari had in July 2020 approved the development of the Brass Gas Company with the sole aim of aggregating and monetizing all stranded gas in the Brass area, which amounts to over 10 trillion cubic feet of gas, into the processing facilities to be built in the hub.” “The project will have significant economic and developmental impact on the country, including support for gas-based industries, revenue generation and import substitution for methanol needs of the nation that is currently 100 percent imported. “Other economic benefits include foreign direct investment, economic diversification, acceleration of Nigeria’s march to zero gas flaring and community development through the company’s plan to offer one percent equity to host communities.” On his part, Wabote underscored the significance of two Federal Government’s agencies – NCDMB and NNPC catalysing investments in the country. “The project will place Nigeria in the world’s map as one of the top 10 producers of methanol. “Local Content can only grow sustainably when there are oil and gas projects. A mega project of this size provides opportunities to utilize local capacities and capabilities built over the years. “Opportunities provided by this project in job creation, gas utilization, local availability of methanol for primary and secondary users, formed part of the basis of the Board’s decision to partner with Brass Fertiliser and Petrochemicals Company Ltd to enhance delivery of the project.” Vanguard News Nigeria ...China, AfDB, others to raise 70% total cost ...Targets 35,000 jobs ...Plant to be completed by 2025 By Prince Okafor The Federal Government has committed an equity investment of $670m for the construction of 10,000 tonnes per day methanol production plant by the Brass Fertiliser and Petrochemical Company Ltd (BFPCL).… January 30, 2021 In "News" BRASS FERTILISER & Petrochemical Company Limited (BFPCL) has secured $6 billion offshore facility for the takeoff of its methanol plant in Bayelsa State.
