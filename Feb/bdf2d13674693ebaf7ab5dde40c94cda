Speaking at the event, the Divisional Head, Listings Business, NSE, Mr. Olumide Bolumole noted, “The traditional role of The Exchange as a platform for capital formation and liquidity holds good promise for businesses.

It reflects   recognition of the role played by the Chamber of Commerce in promoting the growth and competitiveness of private enterprise in Nigeria. Going forward, I am hopeful that initiatives such as this webinar will spur greater interest in the activities of the Growth Board by the private sector, as it is a conscious effort to give credence to SMEs which are the building blocks of the Nigerian economy.” THE Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) has called for collaboration with the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) to explore financing options for small and medium-scale enterprises (SMEs).
