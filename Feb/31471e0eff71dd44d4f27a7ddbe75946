Commenting on the performance,   David Wright, Managing Director, CAP Plc, said: “CAP recorded modest top-line growth last year despite the COVID-19 lockdown in the second quarter of 2020 and protests in the fourth quarter of 2020, effectively losing seven weeks of sales. “We are encouraged by the growth in revenue which has been solely driven by underlying volume growth in line with our strategy. Alongside the rest of the world, we experienced supply chain disruptions which impacted our raw material sourcing and resulted in input costs pressures. “We have embarked on initiatives focused on mitigating these disruptions and expect to see positive results in 2021.” Notore Chemical Industries Plc, has recorded   a six   percent growth in revenue to   ¦ 17.4 billion, as well as   operating income of ¦ 3.8 billion for the nine months ended June 30, 2020.
