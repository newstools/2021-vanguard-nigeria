Employees spend 65 to 80% of their salary in the first 1 to 2 weeks of getting paid, exposing them to financial stress and risk when they have emergencies, alternatively, they have to take loans which take more from them than they get. To solve this problem we have developed WageX, a zero (0%) interest salary advance tailored to help you as an employee or your employees meet financial emergencies with instant access up to ₦200,000 before payday. Fundamentally, when employees experience financial instability it sometimes leads to low productivity, absence from work, and in extreme situations fraud or theft for employers who now don’t have to reject salary advance requests from their employees anymore; through WageX, they can now help their employees meet their needs. “We are building through our group of top-tier consumer finance experts, innovative modules & products, to deliver affordable finance for the underserved African population”. Loans 2 Go CEO George Badejo-Adegbenga. WageX is designed in the full view of our mission at Loans 2 Go, giving your employees not just access to zero (0%) salary advance but a credit improvement system to help them achieve better financial stability and lifestyle. When you make a request, your bank account gets credited in under 5minutes after approval, and you only get charged a one-time 5% mark-up fee with no additional or hidden charges. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1543501" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/wageX.jpg?resize=640%2C640&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="640" height="640" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/wageX.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i2.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/wageX.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/wageX.jpg?resize=1024%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/wageX.jpg?resize=107%2C107&amp;ssl=1 107w, https://i2.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/wageX.jpg?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/wageX.jpg?resize=58%2C58&amp;ssl=1 58w, https://i2.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/wageX.jpg?resize=194%2C194&amp;ssl=1 194w, https://i2.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/wageX.jpg?resize=130%2C130&amp;ssl=1 130w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1" /> WageX is a complete experience of stress-free and affordable finance, you are free from collaterals, providing a guarantor or paperwork.
