According to the hitmaker, he is tired of racial injustice in America and he can’t watch his great-grandchildren beg for respect and value. “I want to see the nation smile again, and I want to see it before I move to Ghana,” he told Oprah. “I’m going to do that. I’m going to move permanently to Ghana.” “Because I don’t want to see my children’s children’s children’s have to say ‘Oh please, like me. Please respect me. Please value me. What kind of sh*t is that?” He added: “I want the world to get better. I want us to get beyond this place. I want us all to go to the funeral of hate.
