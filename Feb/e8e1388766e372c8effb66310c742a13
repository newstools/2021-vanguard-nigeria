Uromi women in Edo state, Wednesday protested against the fulani’s living in the state, demanding that they must leave their community. With pictures of them chanting, #FulanimustGo, the women said they can no longer go to their farms, due to the fear that they may be killed by herdsmen. They were seen blocking major roads in the town. :<img class="size-full wp-image-1533807 aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/edo1.jpg?resize=600%2C576&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="600" height="576" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/edo1.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/edo1.jpg?resize=300%2C288&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/edo1.jpg?resize=58%2C56&amp;ssl=1 58w, https://i0.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/edo1.jpg?resize=202%2C194&amp;ssl=1 202w, https://i0.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/edo1.jpg?resize=135%2C130&amp;ssl=1 135w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" /> <img class="size-full wp-image-1533808 aligncenter" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/edo2.jpg?resize=600%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="600" height="600" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/edo2.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i2.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/edo2.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/edo2.jpg?resize=107%2C107&amp;ssl=1 107w, https://i2.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/edo2.jpg?resize=58%2C58&amp;ssl=1 58w, https://i2.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/edo2.jpg?resize=194%2C194&amp;ssl=1 194w, https://i2.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/edo2.jpg?resize=130%2C130&amp;ssl=1 130w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" /> <img class="size-full wp-image-1533809 aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/edo3.jpg?resize=600%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="600" height="600" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/edo3.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/edo3.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/edo3.jpg?resize=107%2C107&amp;ssl=1 107w, https://i0.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/edo3.jpg?resize=58%2C58&amp;ssl=1 58w, https://i0.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/edo3.jpg?resize=194%2C194&amp;ssl=1 194w, https://i0.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/edo3.jpg?resize=130%2C130&amp;ssl=1 130w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" /> <img class="size-full wp-image-1533810 aligncenter" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/edo5.jpg?resize=600%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="600" height="600" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/edo5.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i2.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/edo5.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/edo5.jpg?resize=107%2C107&amp;ssl=1 107w, https://i2.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/edo5.jpg?resize=58%2C58&amp;ssl=1 58w, https://i2.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/edo5.jpg?resize=194%2C194&amp;ssl=1 194w, https://i2.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/edo5.jpg?resize=130%2C130&amp;ssl=1 130w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" /> Note: Photos from BBC Pigin Live from Uromi for Edo state: Women don block major roads, as dem dey demand say #FulanimustGo.
