Oshiomhole stated yesterday while fielding questions from journalists shortly after revalidating his membership of the party at Unit 1, ward 10, Iyamho, Etsako West local government of  Edo state, He said,”APC is govern by a constitution and not by man, the constitution only provides for registration and I registered as a member of the APC in 2014 under the Interim national chairman Chief Bisi Akande,” “There is nothing in the APC constitution that says a member shall revalidate or renew its membership. Once you registered when you joined the party and you have not decamped, you are a member . So revalidation is strange to our constitution,” “I have only done this because I want peace to reign but in doing this, we have to be careful not to create constitutional breach,” He however noted that between 2015 and now people have exited from the party and others have joined party while some have died, adding that it make sense to review the register so that those who have decamped to APC will be registered while those who have  left would be delete. ” If you ask me as a foundation member who have never decamped to revalidate my membership,  it is double registration because there is nothing like revalidation in our constitution. ” By asking me to revalidate my membership means I was not a member when I have never leave the party, so I think the correct language should be  either reviewing or updating because it make sense to review voters register due to the new members that have joined or those that have exited,”. He said the party has been updating its register from time to time, noting that most of the governors under the party today became members following voters register update hence they were able to contest the governorship election under the party. “So what this  means now is that I have come here to do another registration but I insist that my registration never expired within the provision of the APC constitution,”. He said, “as for me, I think we should just moved on, I am happy I just did it but I don’t need it because my membership has not expired and it can only expired when I decamped,  and if I am returning then I can revalidate,”. “History didn’t just begins today, if we don’t have a valid register, how did we conducted the congress in 2015 in which 16 million registered APC members  voted to nominate  president Muhammadu Buhari before the general election,”. He said at one of the party National Executive Council   meeting in Abuja when he was the national chairman, he has  the honour of presenting membership card to President Buhari.
