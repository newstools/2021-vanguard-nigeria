Consequently, the market capitalisation which opened at N21.715 trillion shed N426 billion or 1.96 per cent to close at N21.289 trillion due to massive profit-taking. Similarly, the All-Share Index dipped 814.15 points or 1.96 per cent to close at 40,696.01 from 41,510.16 recorded on Tuesday. The market loss was driven by price depreciation in large and medium-capitalised stocks amongst which were; Fidson, Chemical & Allied Products, Regency Alliance Insurance, Sovereign Trust Insurance and Sunu Assurance. Mr Ambrose Omorodion, Chief Operating Officer, InvestData Ltd., attributed the persistent lull to profit-taking and sell pressure, ahead of earnings season. He added that mixed unaudited full year results released so far by the NSE contributed to the development. “For discerning investors, these pullbacks have created an opportunity to position ahead of earnings expectations,” Omorodion said. Market breadth remained negative with 37 laggards and 13 gainers. CAP, Sunu Assurance, eTranzact International, Fidson Healthcare, Regency Alliance Insurance, and Sovereign Trust Insurance drove the losers’ chart in percentage terms, dropping 10 per cent each to close at N18, 81k, N2.25, N5.40, 27 kobo and 27k per share, respectively. Mutual Benefit Assurance followed with 9.76 per cent to close at 37k, while Linkage Assurance shed 9.09 per cent to close at 60k per share. Conversely, Niger Insurance dominated the gainers’ table in percentage terms, gaining 10 per cent to close at 22k per share. Champion Breweries trailed with 9.82 per cent to close at N3.02, while Wapic Insurance rose by 7.41 per cent to close at 58k per share.
