The complainant presented a certified true copy of the judgment from the FCT high court awarding him N1million (one million naira) in respect of the cruel and inhuman and degrading treatment against him by some operatives of the Nigeria Police Force. Marcus disclosed to the panel that before he submitted his petition last year, he had filed a case seeking enforcement of his fundamental rights at the FCT High Court for hearing and determination. In his matter before the court, he alleged that he was arrested and detained following a dispute arising from a failed contract between him and one Ms Margret Idonijie. This, according to him, led to his unlawful arrest and detention, where he was severely tortured resulting to a discharge from his ears, he was asked to sleep on the bare floor with continuous acts of torture until he agreed to sign a post-dated cheque before he was released. “On the 21st January, 2021 theFCT High Court gave a judgement in my favour and ordered the Nigeria Police to pay me the sum of N1million as damages”, the complainant stated. Marcus also pleaded with the panel to monitor the enforcement of the decision of the High Court to ensure a quick response from the Nigeria Police. In addition, he sought that the panel should compel one Sergent Idris Zakari to return his silver wedding ring which he (Zakari) repossessed after he was released from police custody. Garba Tetengi SAN who stood in for the chairman of the panel admitted the court judgment as evidence and also directed the respondents’ counsel led by James Idachaba to produce Idris Zakari at the next adjourned hearing.
