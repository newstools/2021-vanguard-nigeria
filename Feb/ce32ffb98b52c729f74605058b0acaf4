In doing this, we also understand that not all our clients will be interested in buying a house or land. So there is the investment part of it that they can take advantage of. You just put in your money and wait for your ROI.” “In terms of payment plan for Zylus Court, we will make it very flexible for interested buyers. Clients can start with as little as an initial deposit of N3million then spread the balance into six months and twelve months. A six months payment plan attracts no extra cost but a twelve months plan attracts an additional one million naira. Project Manager, Williams Popoola explained that the structure is at the first-floor slab casting stage three weeks after commencement and will be delivered within twelve weeks. Lateef Lawal Olaoluwa who is Managing Director, Zylus Homes and Properties believes that what makes Zylus stand out among other real estate companies is integrity.
