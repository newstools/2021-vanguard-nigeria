Folorunsho Oladoyin condemned the act of impersonation, stressing that it is shameful and embarrassing that a prospective teacher could be found committing such heinous crimes. He said, “It is shameful that somebody who wants to teach students academically and morally could be involved in fraudulent malpractice, what example is such a person going to set for the students, the commissioner queried.
