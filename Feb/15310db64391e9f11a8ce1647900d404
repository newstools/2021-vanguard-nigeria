A two-thirds majority was needed in the 100-member Senate to convict Trump of the charge of inciting the January 6 attack on the US Capitol by his supporters but only 57 senators voted “guilty.” Seven Republicans joined Democrats in the Senate in voting to convict the former president. Trump denounced his second impeachment trial as “yet another phase of the greatest witch hunt in the history of our Country.” “No president has ever gone through anything like it,” Trump said.
