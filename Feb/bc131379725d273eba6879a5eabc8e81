The police charged Amos with defilement. The defendant, however, pleaded not guilty to the charge. Justice Bello Kawu, gave the order, after the defence counsel, Charles Iwuchukwu made a bail application for the defendant pursuant to Section 36 (5 )of the 1999 Constitution. Kawu adjourned the matter until April 23, for ruling in the bail application and hearing in the case. Iwuchukwu had assured the court that his client will not jump bail, adding that Amos will present reliable surety if bail is granted.
