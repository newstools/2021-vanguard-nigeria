THEY had been at home for 10 months on account of the closure of schools due to the COVID-19 pandemic. They eagerly returned to school mid last month and were set to write their final examinations, graduate and join in the efforts to develop their father land. This will no longer be for Samuel Adesomoju Tobi, a final year law student and Oluwasemire Ojinni, a final year Business Administration student of the Adekunle Ajasin University, Akungba, Ondo State. The duo were among 15 victims of an accident at the university gate on January 23. While Adesomoju was one time president of the Students union of the university, Oluwasemire was the first female president of the National Association of Business Administration and Management Students of AAUA. Sadly, Oluwasemire died with her two siblings in the accident, a development that made their mum to slump and die on hearing the heart-rending news. An articulated truck loaded with cement reportedly lost control due to brake failure and rammed into business centres and shops near the university gate killing no fewer than 15 persons with many sustaining injuries. The AAUA accident is one of the 25 reported ghastly auto crashes of January 2021. The 15 deaths are among no fewer than 41,257 deaths recorded on our highways in 97 months, according to the Federal Road Safety Commission, FRSC, Nigeria Bureau of Statistics, NBS, and reported crashes tallied by Saturday Vanguard. The figures excluded unreported cases and those who later died from injuries sustained from the crashes. The death toll shows that every six hours, no fewer than four lives are lost on Nigerian roads. The daily toll is 15 persons and the monthly tally is 426 persons. And every year, about 20,000 of the 11.854 million vehicles in the country are involved in accidents, Saturday Vanguard’s investigations and analysis of data released by the National Bureau of Statistics, and the Federal Road Safety Comission have shown. According to the NBS, the number of lives lost to road traffic accidents from January 2013 to 2019 are as follows: 2013 – 5,539; 2014 – 4,430; 2015 – 5,400; (FRSC):  2016 – 5,053; 2017 – 5,049; 2018 –5, 181; 2019 – 5,483. Between January and March 2020, there were 1,758 deaths; April to June 2020, 855 deaths; and July to September 2020, 1,076 deaths. The FRSC and NBS were yet to release the data for October to December, 2020 but Saturday Vanguard’s tally of reported cases showed that no fewer than 1,229 auto crash deaths occurred. This means that 4,918 deaths were recorded in 2020. Also, in January 2021, Saturday Vanguard’s checks indicated that about 25 ghastly accidents that claimed no fewer than 204 lives took place across the country.

Indeed, in May 2017, the FRSC said that there were 33.7 deaths per 100,000 people in Nigeria every year, making Nigeria one of the countries with the highest number of fatalities in Africa. The FRSC Corps Marshal, Boboye Oyeyemi, made the disclosure during the flag-off of the Global Road Safety Week at the Nigeria Union of Journalists, NUJ, Secretariat, Kaduna. Zimbabwe has the worst road fatality in the world with 74.5 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants. The world average is 17.4; Africa is 26.6; and, according to the International Transport Forum, ITF, Road Safety Annual Report for 2018, the fatality rate for South Africa is 21 while Norway has the least road fatality with two deaths per 100,000 inhabitants.

To reduce carnage on Nigerian roads, the FRSC, Public Education Officer, Bisi Kazeem, reportedly said that the FRSC had ensured full use of the services of the National Traffic Radio 107.1 FM, including its live stream on social media platforms to reach out to the motoring public. He encouraged drivers to obey traffic laws and regulations and cooperate with traffic officers, as it was in their best interests and that of other road users. The report said a total of 5,535 people got injured in the road traffic crashes recorded. This represents an average of 61 persons per day in three. The NBS further said, “major causative factors of road crashes in the period under review are speed violation, wrongful overtaking, use of handsets while driving, dangerous overtaking and other factors”. “Speed violation accounted for 47 per cent of the total road crashes reported,” the bureau said, adding that “wrongful overtaking followed closely as it accounted for 10 per cent of the total road crashes recorded, while dangerous overtaking recorded the least of the total road crashes reported”. According to NBS, a total of 3,334 vehicles were involved in road traffic crashes in those months, with cars reported to be the major type of vehicle involved in road crashes. “Cars accounted for 28 per cent of the vehicles involved in road crashes reported followed by motorcycle and minibus as they both accounted for 24 and 15 per cent respectively.” FRSC spokesperson Bisi Kazeem said a total of 2,656 road crashes were reported between July and September, adding that the road police agency had not relented in its efforts at reducing carnage on the highways. He attributed most of the road crashes and deaths that occurred along various routes in the country within the period to over-speeding. Kazeem urged the motoring public to cooperate with the FRSC, saying that it would go a long way in preventing incessant crashes on the roads. The spokesperson appealed to motorists to desist from buying used or fake tyres and opt for good ones to save lives and properties. Kazeem encouraged drivers to obey traffic rules, regulations and cooperate with traffic officers, as it was in their best interests and that of other road users.
