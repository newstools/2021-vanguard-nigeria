The residents who were rendered incommunicado throughout their period of captivity were freed following the consideration of a bail application filed on Wednesday, 10th February, 2021 before an Abuja Grade 11 Magistrate Court sitting in Wuse by a human rights lawyer, Barr. E.R Okoroafor. This was contained in a statement made available to Vanguard by an Onitsha-based human rights group, the International Society for Civil Liberties and Rule of Law, Intersociety, on Thursday. According to the statement which was signed by the rights group’s Chairman of Board of Trustees, Emeka Umeagbalasi, and other principal officers, 53 other residents have been located in the DSS dungeons while searches are on to trace and free the remaining 140 others who were part of the 400 law-abiding residents of Obigbo while they were going about their lawful businesses between October and November, 2020. Part of the statement reads “The International Society for Civil Liberties & Rule of Law-INTERSOCIETY is happily announcing another major breakthrough in its campaigns to expose and end a booklet of atrocity crimes that have ravaged the Nigerian Army particularly under the immediate past Chief of Army Staff, Lt Gen Tukur Yusuf Buratai. This time, the major breakthrough recorded was the release on Monday, 15th Feb 2021 of 63 Obigbo residents, all males. They were reportedly detained by the Nigerian Army at Obigbo in Rivers State and held incommunicado for four months or since Oct 2020 in Mogadishu Barracks and other security dungeons in Abuja. “Their release followed the landmark consideration of their bail application filed on Wednesday, 10thFeb 2021 before an Abuja Grade 11 Magistrate Court sitting in Wuse. “They were freed from four different Army, DSS and Police dungeons in Abuja and environs; namely: Mogadishu Army Barracks, Annex B at Asokoro, DSS Training Center at Central Business District and its abandoned facility at Zuba and the Nigeria Police College at Suleja in Niger State. “The freed victims were part of over 400 innocent and defenceless Obigbo residents including over 60 girls and young women detained between Oct and Nov 2020 at their workplaces or on their way home from work or while engaging in other lawful social activities. “The release of the 63 residents was made possible through the lawyerly and activist doggedness of Barr E.R. Okoroafor. Barr E.R. Okoroafor is a British citizen of Igbo nativity and international human rights lawyer. “The efforts of the leadership of IPOB in this respect are also worthily recognized and appreciated. “While it is hopeful that the newly located 53 young women in the DSS dungeons will soon regain their freedom, bringing the total number of the located or freed to 261; searches are still on to locate the remaining residents numbering over 140. “This is owing to the fact that the Nigerian Army and DSS have refused to speak publicly on the whereabouts of the residents, the freed ones and why the over 400 residents were in the first place kept out of public knowledge till date.” Vanguard News Nigeria By Anayo Okoli, Vincent Ujumadu, Dennis Agbo, Ugochukwu Alaribe, Chimaobi Nwaiwu, Chinedu Adonu, Peter Okuku, Chinonso Alozie & Ikechukwu Odu ENUGU — OBIGBO, a major Igbo settlement in Oyigbo Local Government Area of Rivers State was in the news for negative reasons during the recent #EndSARS protests that was hijacked… November 18, 2020 In "South East Voice" …We wonder why IGP allowed police dress like criminals —INC By Chimaobi Nwaiwu & Chinonso Alozie The Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, yesterday raised the alarm  over the alleged disappearance and secret killing of its members by the Special Anti Robbery Squad across Biafra States, calling on  the Nigerian Federal… October 6, 2020 In "News" …Blame FG, IPoB leader, Wike for outbreak of violence in Rivers — Igbo youths …Wike clarifies position By Dennis Agbo & Peter Okutu President-General of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Chief Nnia Nwodo and the group's former youth leader, Okechukwu Isiguzoro, yesterday,  said the continued massacre of innocent Igbo residents in Oyigbo, Rivers… November 4, 2020 In "News"
