DSP Abiodu Wasiu, the Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO) in the state, disclosed this during an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Minna. “The police responded to the distressed call to restore law and order in the area. We have made some arrest but I cannot give you the figure right now because investigation is ongoing,” he said. Wasiu said that when investigations are concluded the suspects would be arraigned in Court. NAN recalls that on Tuesday irate youth had joined traders in Brighter road area of Minna to attack officials of NSUDB who were in the area to remove illegal structures. The youths and traders also vent their anger on the state deputy governor’s private residence, Alhaji Ahmed Ketso, in the area, alleging that the house was also built on the road. Mr Mohammed Baba, Acting General Manager, NSUDB, who also confirmed the incident to NAN, said that the officials of the board were attacked during an operation to remove illegal structures in the area. Baba said that during the attack three operational vehicles of the board were damaged. He said that it was an ongoing exercise which would be extended to all the urban areas across the state. The Acting General Manager said that all the affected persons were served with notices contrary to what some of the affected traders claimed.
