Porto edged Juventus 2-1 in their Champions League last 16, first leg clash Wednesday with the lacklustre Italian giants needing a late goal to grab a lifeline in the tie. Porto’s Iran attacker Mehdi Taremi pounced on an under-hit back-pass from Rodrigo Bentancur to beat Wojciech Szczesny in the Juve goal with barely a minute gone. Mali striker Moussa Marega added the second in the 46th minute after fine approach work by full-back Wilson Manafa. However, Juve stayed afloat with eight minutes left when Federico Chiesa scored with a first-time effort from Adrien Rabiot’s cross. The second leg of the tie is in Turin on March 9.
