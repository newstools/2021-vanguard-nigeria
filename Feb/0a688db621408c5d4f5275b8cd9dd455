Dear Pile Sufferer, Can I tell you an honest fact? They lied to you! They told you pile can only managed AND NOT permanently treated. Then they give you all manner of balms, ointments and cream to rub on your anus that doesn’t work! The worst part? You believed them! But it’s not your fault. Humans tend to give up and believe whatever they are told if they seem to not get the exact result they so desire. Here is what I mean…
You were told you cannot get a long-lasting solution that will permanently cure your pile. I know you have tried treating pile, using all sort of drugs, balms, ointments and cream… You use them.
Your pile seems to disappear. But before you know it, it comes back again. And now you’re frustrated, in pain and almost on the verge of giving up.   Rubbing a balm, cream or ointment on the surface alone can only attack the external effect BUT DOESN’T address it internally… the same as taking capsule alone. They only have a temporal, patch-up effect… It’s like treating the “leaves” of a bad tree WITHOUT getting to the “roots”(where the main cause is.) But here is the GOOD NEWS: Finally you can get rid of your pile. Just stay with me. I will show you how soon. But before then, just so we are clear… What Is Pile? And How Exactly Does It Form? Piles (hemorrhoids) are enlarged blood vessels that you can get inside or around your anus. They’re usually small, round, discoloured lumps. You might be able to feel them on your anus or hanging down from your anal canal. Your anal canal is the short, muscular tube with blood vessels that connects your rectum (back passage) with your anus. It’s completely normal to have blood vessels in your anus – they have an important role to play in continence. But piles are when they get enlarged, swollen and cause you severe pain and discomfort. We Have Two Different Kinds Of Pile :  - Internal Pile, and – External Pile Let me explain each of them so you can understand better: Internal piles: They start inside your anal canal, but they might hang down and come out your anus. They’re graded according to whether they come out, and if so, how far they come out – this is a general classification and the symptoms can vary between individuals. First degree piles may bleed but don’t come out of your anus. Second degree piles come out of your anus when you have a bowel movement, but go back inside on their own afterwards. Third degree piles come out of your anus and only go back inside if you physically push them back in. Fourth degree piles always hang down from your anus and you can’t push them back in. They can become very swollen and painful if the blood inside them clots. External piles: They are swellings that develop further down your anal canal, closer to your anus. They can be really painful, especially if they have a blood clot in them. It’s possible to have both internal and external piles at the same time. What Causes Piles Piles develop when the veins in your anal canal become swollen, which may happen for a number of reasons, such as: if you strain when you go to the toilet, for example if you have constipation or long-lasting diarrhoea having a persistent cough lifting heavy objects Piles are also common during pregnancy. They may develop due to changes in your hormones and the higher pressure in your tummy (abdomen) when you’re pregnant. They usually get better after you give birth. Clear Symptoms Of Pile Include: bleeding when you have a bowel movement – you may see blood (usually bright red) on toilet paper or drips in the toilet or on the surface of your poo a lump in or around your anus a slimy discharge of mucus from your anus a feeling of ‘fullness’ and discomfort in your anus, or a feeling that your bowels haven’t completely emptied after going to the toilet. itchy or sore skin around your anus pain and discomfort during stooling (or after you go to the toilet.) More Severe Symptoms Are: Anal infections as a result of the protrusion of the anus, exposing it to direct infections. Constant bleeding. At this time you would carry tissue paper around as drips of blood always comes out of your anus. It can be embarrassing! Anal cancer… if care is not taken, an early stage pile can eventually lead to cancer of the anus (where your anus leaks uncontrollably and you can’t be able to pass out stools. imagine passing out stool through your stomach with a pipe connected!) At Any phase, Pile Is Dangerous… If NOT permanently treated Can Develop Into Other Complications As Listed Above… Before I go on to FINALLY to hand you a proven, natural solution to your pile. It will be good you see the different GRADES OF PILE, so you can know the best solution to it. <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1529435" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/pile9.jpg?resize=640%2C288&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="640" height="288" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/pile9.jpg?resize=1024%2C461&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/pile9.jpg?resize=300%2C135&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/pile9.jpg?resize=768%2C346&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/pile9.jpg?resize=58%2C26&amp;ssl=1 58w, https://i2.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/pile9.jpg?resize=260%2C117&amp;ssl=1 260w, https://i2.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/pile9.jpg?resize=200%2C90&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i2.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/pile9.jpg?w=1040&amp;ssl=1 1040w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1" /> GRADE 1 PILE: these are small inflammation and swelling in the anus, they are not always visible but you Feel it
