Mr Ikharo Attah, Head, Publicity and Enlightenment, FCT Ministerial Enforcement Task Force on COVID-19, made the remark after monitoring the compliance level in some mosques at Wuse, Utako and Maitama Districts, in Abuja. Attah urged Imams to ensure that their congregants adhered strictly to physical distancing during prayers. “The usage of face masks, sanitisers and hand washing points in the mosques visited are quite encouraging. “The Imams and Ulamas have put in place measures to ensure compliance from the entry points,” he said. According to him, most mosques have shortened their sermon and prayer times to prevent people from staying longer in the places of worship. “The only mosque we were not encouraged with is the Uthman Bin Alfa Mosque, Wuse II which is located opposite Banex Plaza. “Though worshippers who entered the premises wear face masks, there was no infrared thermometer for a temperature check, no handwashing points and no sanitisers at the entry points into the mosque,” he said. Attah, therefore, advised Secretary of the mosque to ensure that all anomalies are corrected before the next prayers. Meanwhile, at the Ansarul Islam National Mosque, Utako District, the team also frowned at the fact that security men at the gate enforcing compliance with the COVID-19 protocols were not wearing facemasks. The enforcement team also inspected compliance at the An-nur Mosque, Wuse II and the Ansar Udeen Islamic mosque Maitama. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that in all the mosques visited face masks vendors were spotted making brisk business at the various entry points. NAN observes that most worshippers who were denied entry for not coming with their face masks patronised them.
