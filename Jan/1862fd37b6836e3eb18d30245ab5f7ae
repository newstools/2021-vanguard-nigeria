According to information gathered, some officers of the security outfit tried to disperse the youths which resulted in stiff resistance by the youths. The source said, “In the course of trying to stop the carnival, there was an argument between the boys and the Amotekun men which made the boys throw stones at them.” “Along the line, the Amotekun officers started shooting directly at them and now, at least three people have been confirmed dead while many people were injured.” “Bullets were being removed from some people who did not partake in the carnival at all”. The Commander of Amotekun Corps in the state, Col. Olayinka Olayanju(rtd), could not confirm the incident because he was on his way to the place. He said, “I am on my way to Tapa. I am on my way to Tapa. I can’t tell you anything now until I investigate. I am on my way to Tapa ”.
