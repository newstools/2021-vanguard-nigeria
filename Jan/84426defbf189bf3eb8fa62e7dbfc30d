Singapore started vaccinating healthcare workers on Dec. 30, becoming one of the first Asian countries to start its coronavirus inoculation programme. The nation of 5.7 million people has been reporting relatively very few local cases in recent months and fatalities are among the world’s lowest, with just 29 coronavirus-related deaths. It has so far approved only the Pfizer-BioNTech’s vaccine but has said it has secured enough doses from other vaccine-makers like Moderna and Sinovac to give to all citizens and residents by the third quarter this year.

Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong received his first shot of the COVID-19 vaccine last week.
