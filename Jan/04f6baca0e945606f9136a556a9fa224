Hamid   Bobboyi, has begged parents in the North to at least allow their female children conclude their secondary school education before considering them for marriage. Bobboyi said girls’ education is vital to the development of any country. According to a statement by the Head, Public Relations and Protocols, David Apeh, Bobboyi spoke at the inauguration of Girl Child Community Center in Gafia Village, Kaita Local Government Area of Katsina State. “Without education of the girl child, we can’t change our society, we should allow them to finish their secondary school education before marrying them off,” he said. The UBEC boss advised that even after marrying, the girl child should still be allowed to continue the search for knowledge. He said the commission was glad with the Kastina State Government for its numerous policies of promoting basic education especially that of the girl child.
