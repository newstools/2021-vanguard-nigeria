He is the first president in US history to be twice impeached – to be charged with crimes by Congress. Mr Trump, a Republican, will now face a trial in the Senate, where if convicted he could face being barred from ever holding office again. The impeachment measure passed largely along party lines. Mr Trump is due to leave office on 20 January, following his election defeat last November to Democrat Joe Biden. After several hours of impassioned debate on Wednesday, the Democratic-controlled House voted. Six Republicans said beforehand they would side with Democrats to impeach the president. But the majority of conservatives remained loyal to Mr Trump. But it is unlikely Mr Trump will have to leave the White House before his term in office ends in one week as the Senate was not expected to convene in time. Last week, 139 Republicans voted against accepting the result of the 2020 election and Mr Trump’s defeat, BBC reported.
