Graduate employability and earnings – Aston University graduates are among the highest paid in the country five years after graduating; the 2020 Longitudinal Education Outcomes (LEO) ranked Aston graduates at 15th in median earnings of £33,200 in the five years after graduation Outstanding student support – Aston has a suite of support services for students, including counselling, peer mentoring, maths tutorials and study skills workshops. We’re ranked 11th in the UK for Continuation, which measures how well we support students (Guardian University Guide, 2021) Closing attainment gaps – In 2018/19, 59% of Aston University’s students achieving the grade of 1st class or 2:1 were from Black, Asian, and Minority Ethnic (BAME) backgrounds – the highest proportion in the sector (Higher Education Statistics Agency 2018/19)
Embedding sustainability – Aston is one of the ‘greenest’ universities in the UK and is in the top 10 of the 2019 People and Planet University Green League. Professor Alec Cameron, Vice-Chancellor of Aston University, said:
“Being named ‘University of the Year’ by The Guardian is a fantastic testament to the hard work of all our staff and students here at Aston. I am incredibly proud of our diverse, creative and dynamic community who, particularly since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, have proven that we are truly a team. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1528543" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image001.png?resize=600%2C120&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="600" height="120" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image001.png?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i2.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image001.png?resize=300%2C60&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image001.png?resize=58%2C12&amp;ssl=1 58w, https://i2.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image001.png?resize=260%2C52&amp;ssl=1 260w, https://i2.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image001.png?resize=200%2C40&amp;ssl=1 200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" /> “I’ve been particularly inspired by how our staff and students have risen to the challenge of the last nine months, as the education and assessment of our students was disrupted and we moved to online education. Our staff have worked tirelessly to enable us to prepare for a blended delivery model of teaching starting in the autumn term. “This award is also a recognition of the work by our staff across the University to ensure we are giving students the best possible learning experience and supporting them to achieve the best possible outcomes.
“The resilience and flexibility of everyone in our community during this difficult time has been outstanding and I am delighted that they have received this accolade.” Other notable areas include Aston University’s engagement with the Race Equality Charter and gaining the institutional Silver Athena SWAN award in 2018. The award encourages and recognises commitment to advancing the careers of women in science, technology, engineering, maths and medicine (STEMM) employment in higher education and research. The University also signed up as a member of the Race Equality Charter in November 2019. Rachel Hall, Universities Editor at The Guardian, said:
“Aston University came top of the measure this year thanks to its sustained improvement in The Guardian University Guide, along with its commitment to sustainability and a focus on enabling students from a wide range of backgrounds to achieve their potential, including graduate employability.” Matt Hiely-Rayner, compiler of the University of the Year award and the University Guide, added:
“Aston University has been on an upward trajectory since our 2017 Guide, when the University fell out of the top 50 for the first time. Climbing in steady increments, the University has reached 30th position and has achieved this while catering to a very diverse student body. “Meanwhile the University has been taking its commitment to sustainability very seriously. Scoring 63% in the people & planet rankings of 2019, Aston University has the ninth highest score of the institutions included in our rankings.”
