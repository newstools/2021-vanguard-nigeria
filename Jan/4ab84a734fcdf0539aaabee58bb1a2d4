The Health Minister, Dr. Zweli Mkhize made the announcement during a live briefing on the country’s vaccines rollout strategy on Wednesday evening. According to him, “One million vaccine doses are scheduled to leave India on Sunday, 31 January and is scheduled to arrive on Monday, 01 February 2020.” He said the Nation is expected to receive the first batch of 1 million doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine, a product referred to as “COVIDSHIELD” produced by the Serum Institute of India.
