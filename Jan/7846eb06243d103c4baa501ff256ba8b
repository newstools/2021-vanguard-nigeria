According to him, “The President and former service chiefs have responded to the call of the people. As you are aware, many well-meaning Nigerians and stakeholders had before now called on the service chiefs to resign. “Most notably is the Senate and the House of Representatives, which had at different times passed resolutions calling for a change in the service chiefs. Mr. President has just listened to the counsel of the Nigerian people. “We thank the service chiefs for resigning and especially President Muhammadu Buhari for accepting their resignation and promptly appointing new service chiefs to hit the ground running”, he stated.
