This comes as US VP Pence on Wednesday publicly broke with President Donald Trump, saying he cannot submit to Trump’s demands for him to overthrow the results of the 2020 US election after Joe Biden won more popular and electoral college votes than Trump. On Thursday, the US Electoral College also confirmed Biden as the winner of the US presidential election. Also Thursday, Trump’s supporters stormed the US Capitol Hill complex, which many have condemned and described as a shameful day for America’s democracy. “Yesterday the president of the United States incited an armed insurrection against America,” US Speaker Nancy Pelosi said. Many Nigerians on social media have noted that this has never been the case in Nigeria under President Buhari. They added that the comparison between Pence’s action and Trump and Osinbajo in relation to Buhari was partisan and not based on facts, especially as the issue was based on allegiance to the US constitution and not personal biases or loyalty to a person. According to Nigerians, Osinbajo has always stood for truth, justice and upheld democracy as Nigeria’s number two citizen. Others pointed to the fact that the VP The VP respects and upholds the tenets of the Constitutions and rule of law. They noted that it was Osinbajo (then as Acting President) who sacked the former Director General, State Security Service, Lawal Daura, when he violated the sanctity of the National Assembly. Osinbajo had then described the unauthorised takeover of the National Assembly complex “as a gross violation of constitutional order, rule of law and all acceptable notions of law and order.” Also, others pointed to the VP’s direct role in ensuring that the Federal Government meet the demands arising from the EndSARS protests, including the disbandment of the controversial Special Anti-Robbery squad unit (SARS) and the establishment of judicial panels to prosecute police brutality and ensure justice for victims. *NIGERIANS DEFEND OSINBAJO AGAINST PARTISAN ATTACKS IN COMPARISON WITH PENCE*

Comparing *VP Pence* with *VP Osinbajo* smirks of utmost *ignorance* . *Osinbajo* whom even the opposition has hailed for his *immense contribution* to Judicial Reform, Security and most importantly the Economy of this nation
While it is proper that we hold public officers accountable, it is honorable to do a bit of research and *give credit to those who are doing Something Right* . Mayowa Olaniyan @olaniyanmayowa wrote, “Even in the midst of this mess Pence never stood up to his Boss but stood to uphold the Constitution. Just like Pence, Osinbajo stands for the Nigerian constitution and not against his Boss. The Sacking of Lawal Daura is a testament to this fact.
Not every VP can be like Atiku.” Gloria Adagbon @gloria_adagbon noted that the comparison was false, stating that “VP Osinbajo is loyal & dedicated to helping his boss serve Nigeria better. During #EndSARS Osinbajo stood for Nigeria by his patriotic actions.” Olalekan Adigun
@MrLekanAdigun wrote Osinbajo is certainty out of the list of politicians to be dragged in Nigeria He posted a writeup that reads Lets stop the comparison and respect Prof Yemi Osinbajo for all his efforts even as the Vice President, if not for him during #ENDSARS Our demands wouldn’t even be anywhere, he has also been following up on the judicial panel and standing up for the youth. Who is Pence? Solomon Adamu @Solex2030 said, “This comparison has no basis, there was never a time that
@ProfOsinbajo had choose between the Constitution of Nigeria and @MBuhari and he choose the later. This only shows how your heart is filled with hatred for his achievement in life CBN Gov Akinsola @cbngov_akin1 added that “there is no basis for comparison between US Mike Pence in relation to his role as Trump’s deputy and Osinbajo’s role as Nigeria’s VP under President Buhari. Trump’s actions many times incited rebellion against the American constitution.” Esiso Mefenaye Fredrick @Mefe_icewrote, “Do you recall the removal of the CJN. What was his comment on the constitutionality of the move? Or the midnight DSS abduction of supreme court judges?” The hypocrisy with Nigerian twitter people is heart wrenching.  Public Education is *URGENTLY NEEDED* in Nigeria! Tony Omatsone
@2bits66_ Let’s focus on our own and make Nigeria better for good, it is out of place and hypocritical comparing Osinbajo to Pence
He also posted a writeup that read: If anyone would compare *VP Pence* who does practically nothing, that even the most uneducated Americans can agree to his docility to *Osinbajo* in 2021, then we have really lost it. David Yakubu @Yakubu_Prince1 tweeted “US vice president can say that but Nigeria Vice President is more active than Mike Pence when he was in office as US VP do you home work well.” Olayemi Esan @Olayemiesan noted that “It was the VP who ensured that the military authorities are subjected to civilian authority on the matter of the investigation of the Lekki shooting by setting up the Panels including the one in Lagos and ensured the military went to the Panel to answer questions.” KekereAwo @lekeolawale also added, “You missed it Have you read the constitutional power of both VP Mike pence under the US constitution is the president of the senate, Osibanjo is not
There is no basis of comparison and it’s not about loyalty. It is what is expected of Mike pence to do constitutionally.” 𝐿єא @Lexanyi said, “VP Osinbajo is ALWAYS the voice and activist inside govt calling to order every act that is against the Nigerian Constitution and securing Presidential authority to reverse same.” Olayemi Esan @Olayemiesan wrote “It was @ProfOsinbajo whose voice was heard loud and clear condemning the shooting incident at Lekki and standing with the people of Lagos when no one in power was speaking about it. This is inspite of the fact that he as VP had no direct supervisory role over security matters. Martin Umaru @Martynez27 said, “That’s a very poor comparison of things and that of Osinbanjo … His loyalty to the Nigerian Constitution hasn’t been tested up to that level. What should he resign for?” Jack Obinyan (Mr Jack) tweeted, “Seeing Osibanjo trending on Twitter I knew it was an attack. His loyalty to our democracy is paining some to their bone marrows, they would wish he declared himself President when Baba was ill. Eeyah, you guys will have to wait till 2023. You can take Ibuprofen till then!” ALHAJI.OMO IYA WAEC. @OMOIYAWAEC77, on his handzle wrote, “If you like, compare Osinbajo with the devil, kokanye, but you see the friendship, understanding, and loyalty between these two was ordained by Almighty God. Nothing will separate them. Osinbajo remains the best Vice President, the entire continent ever produced.” Ekitiketekan1 @EkitiKetekan1 “Osinbajo’s reforming the civil justice system in the state of Lagos, 1. Reduce the backlog of cases in the High Court. Extend the accessibility of the legal system to the wider population. 2. Reduce the average delays and duration of commercial cases before the civil courts. Another wrote, “When I see Osibanjo trending. His Excellency VP Prof. Yemi Osinbajo is the leader that upholds the constitution and democracy. Promoting access to justice & honours the Judiciary autonomy, growing the Economy. Preaching unity. Resilience to solve & face national issues.” “One man openly condemned SARS and secured Presidential authority to dissolve SARS. One man directed the formation of judicial panels across the country to get justice for victims of police brutality. One man has made sure FG programs get to the grassroot. That man is Osinbajo.” Adeagbo Opeyemi @AdeagboOpeyem17, wrote, “Professor Osinbajo is a man that can never be dragged. His integrity, dignity, value, brilliance and loyalty to his country and office speak for him. Simply the best!” Vanguard News Nigeria United States President, Donald Trump's challenger in the US election, Joe Biden, is soon to announce his vice presidential pick.
