Mohammed said in addition to placing more emphasis on corruptionprevention measures and building of integrity systems, high profile corruption cases were currently under investigation and prosecution. He said the emphasis on preventive mechanisms was in response to various local and international reviews and evaluation that Nigeria hadgone through, including those from the United Nations Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC) and even from the TI-CPI. ”In response to these evaluations, a number of significant policies havebeen instituted to enhance transparency and accountability and prevent corruption. “Even in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic, a number of key transparency and accountability policies were developed and are currently being implemented,” the minister said. He listed such policies to  include  the launch by the ICPC, of the National  Ethics Policy which addressed integrity issues on all sectors of the polity. “There is therefore, the need to verify that there is no transposition of figures from year to year due to absence of current data,” the minister said The minister added that different assessments on the same indicators (for instance corruption in the bureaucracy) by different rating institutions had  generated different scores and different rankings across the ranking agencies ”There is the need to understand why these variations occur and consequently the robustness of the methodology and validity of data,” Mohammed said. In the recent TI CPI released on Friday,  Nigeria scored 25/100 which was one point less than its 26 points in the previous year. It said Nigeria was now 149 out of 180 countries, a record that was three steps lower than its rank of 146 in 2019.
