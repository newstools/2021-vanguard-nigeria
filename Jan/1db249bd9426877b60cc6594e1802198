Public Health England said it had been testing tens of thousands of health workers across Britain since June for antibodies. Its researchers found that people can be up to 83 per cent protected against the virus after being previously infected with Covid-19. The protection then appears to last for five months. Between June 18 and Nov. 24, scientists detected 44 potential re-infections, two “probable’’ and 42 “possible’’ reinfections out of 6,614 participants who had tested positive for antibodies. But early evidence from the next stage of the study suggests some people carry high levels of the virus and could transmit it to others. Prof. Susan Hopkins, the senior medical advisor at Public Health England and leader of the study, said: “We now know that most of those who have had the virus, and developed antibodies, are protected from reinfection, but this is not total and we do not yet know how long protection lasts. Crucially, we believe people may still be able to pass the virus on.’’ The team has not yet investigated immune responses from the COVID-19 vaccines, which Britain began rolling out in November. They will investigate people’s bodily reactions to vaccines later in the year. According to the latest figures from the British government, more than 3.2 million people have tested positive for COVID-19 in the four nations since the outbreak began. Vanguard News Nigeria A Philippine government minister has tested positive for coronavirus five months after an initial diagnosis, authorities said Monday, as experts investigate whether he had been re-infected. August 17, 2020 In "Foreign" The World Health Organization (WHO) warned on Saturday that there is no evidence that people who test positive for the new coronavirus are immunised and protected against reinfection. The warning suggests that the issuance of "immune passports" may promote the continued spread of the pandemic. "There is currently no evidence… April 25, 2020 In "Coronavirus Updates" Health experts in Bangladesh have stressed the need to do more research to know about the rapid loss of antibodies in asymptomatic COVID-19 infected people, calling for people to stay vigilant. They also noted the importance of genome sequencing in order to understand more about COVID-19 reinfection. Prof. Samir Saha,… October 28, 2020 In "Health"
