He also lampooned the state House of Assembly for approving over a billion naira for the exercise saying, “I am at a loss as to why the toothless Delta State House of Assembly voted a whopping sum of N1.140 billion naira for the conduct of the election when the state is owing her retired workers a backlog of pension since 2015 running into billions of naira.” Speaking further, he said: “I make bold to say that in virtually all the council areas of the state, election materials and electoral officials are not seen on duty on election day, but at the end results are allocated and announced by DSIEC officials in favour of candidates of the ruling party in the state contrary to our electoral laws. “The recent laughable lopsided creation of state wards by DSIEC under the tacit supervision of Governor Okowa have been greeted with unrest in some council areas in Delta State, while in a recent development, the state governor appealed to Nigerians to resort to prayers in order for Nigeria to surmount her numerous challenges. “I believe that the above challenges and unrest being created by DSIEC and the Delta state government ahead of the forthcoming local government polls in the state can only be surmounted by the state government through equity, justice, good conscience and good governance and not by the prayers of the citizenry.” Vanguard News Nigeria RIGHTS  activist Mr. Oghenejabo Ikimi, yesterday, alleged that opposition parties in the state were scared to challenge the confused guidelines released by the Delta State Independent Electoral Commission, DSIEC, because they do not want to lose their yearly subvention from the State Government.
