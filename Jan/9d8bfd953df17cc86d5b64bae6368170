He added, however, that the situation would be kept under review and flight schedules would be adjusted to demand in the coming days if necessary. On Friday, the German government decided that airlines, railways, buses and shipping companies would no longer be allowed to transport passengers from areas affected by the new, potentially more contagious coronavirus strains to Germany until February 17. There are exceptions, however, and the movement of goods remains unaffected. On Sunday, two small South African states, Lesotho and Eswatini, are due to be added to the list.
