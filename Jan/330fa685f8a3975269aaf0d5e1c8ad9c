Vanguard News Nigeria ARGUABLY, Akwa Ibom is a Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) state. All things being equal, anyone who emerges as the PDP governorship candidate can be taken as the governor-in-waiting. It is therefore not surprising that the race for the PDP ticket is intense often leading to high-wire politicking, bickering and controversies.
