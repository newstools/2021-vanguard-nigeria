Adeyeye noted with dismay that the local manufacturers, in spite of appropriate notification, failed to meet minimum Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) standards in line with extant requirements which are required to assure the quality, safety, and efficacy of pharmaceutical products. She maintained that the companies will remain shut until the respective GMP compliances are met.
