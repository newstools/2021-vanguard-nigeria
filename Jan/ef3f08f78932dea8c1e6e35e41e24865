Itubo said, “Yes, it is true. Early hours of this morning they informed us and we also sent people and we went to confirm. “It is really terrible. I didn’t hear that he was sick. It is just this morning somebody told me that he had a headache and went to the clinic and they were taking care of him, then suddenly early hours of this morning he gave up the ghost. “It is really terrible. This is happening at a time when Chika Onurgbu’s boldness and bravery are needed most.

It is really devastating that this kind of thing is happening at this time,” she added.
