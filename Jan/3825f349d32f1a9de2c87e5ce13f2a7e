He said that the total number of COVID-19 tests conducted in the state since inception of the pandemic stood at 234,508. According to Abayomi, 3,032 COVID-19 patients who had been successfully treated and recovered were discharged from the state’s care centres. “Total number of #COVID19 recovery in communities – 24, 518. “Cases currently under isolation – 170, active cases under home based care are 6,203,” he announced. Abayomi said that the state recorded two new COVID-19 related fatalities, increasing the total deaths to 246. Giving an update on disease severity, he said that 48 per cent of the patients had mild symptoms, 35 per cent had moderate symptoms, while 16 per cent were severe and one per cent had critical symptoms.
