The Italian champions, who face Udinese on Sunday, slumped to their first league defeat of the season against Fiorentina. The result left Pirlo’s side 10 points adrift of league leaders AC Milan, albeit with a game in hand, putting their nine-year stranglehold of the Italian title at risk. “We talked about the game against Fiorentina, we got it completely wrong,” the 41-year-old, who is in his first season as a manager, said. “It was a good meeting and we discussed our future objectives. It was productive. I don’t want to see any more matches like the one with Fiorentina.” “We’ve otherwise made some progress and improved in many aspects, but I’m convinced it can be even better.” Udinese also headed into the winter break following a 2-0 defeat to Benevento but Luca Gotti’s side were unbeaten in six league matches before then. Hence Pirlo is not taking the challenge lightly. “I’m expecting a difficult match, Udinese are on a good run of form and are a very well organised and physical team with players who are very good on the counter-attack,” he said. “The team is eager to redeem itself after the last defeat. We’ve got almost all our players back, so we’re setting out to restart the league season strongly.” NAN Vanguard News Nigeria Cristiano Ronaldo converted a penalty to cap a dominant 3-0 win for Juventus over Fiorentina on Saturday as the Italian champions continued their charge to an eighth consecutive league title by opening an 11-point lead on top of Serie A.
