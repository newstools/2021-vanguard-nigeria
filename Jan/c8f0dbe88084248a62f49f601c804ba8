The awards were received by the various countries’ ambassadors and representatives of institutions present. The organisers also promised to send the others through courier services to the recipients. One of the award recipients, Ms Amany Asfour said the ceremony showed the commitment of the private sector towards the implementation of the AU Agenda 2063. “We need an architecture where the organised private sector would cater for the implementation of the AfCFTA and it is such a pleasure now it has been constituted by the efforts of the AU Commission,” she said. Asfour also urged the players in the private sector to ensure the implementation of the policies regarding the agreement. “We need the legislation that will make it happen with the AfCFTA, the policies can be on paper but the implementation is our role as the private sector. “It is a must to empower our Small and Medium Enterprises, youths and women. We are the richest continent in the world but we need to manage our own resources,” she said. In her remarks, Mrs Saratu Aliyu, President, Federation of West Africa Chambers of Commerce, Industries, Mines and Agriculture (FEWACCI) appreciated governments, private sector players and contributors to the success of the AfCFTA implementation. Aliyu expressed optimism that the agreement would promote e-commerce and e-business infrastructure and develop a roadmap for the development of a digital economy to support the growth in member states. She further reiterated the support of FEWACCI to achieving economic development and growth in Africa.
