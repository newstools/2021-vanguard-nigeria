With this win, the Golden Eaglets have also picked one of the tickets for the 2021 CAF U-17 AFCON scheduled for Morocco later in the year. In the closely contested first semi-finals of the regional tournament, the Golden Eaglets piped their hard fighting Burkina Faso counterpart through a lone goal. Michael Emmanuel put Nigeria ahead in the 77th minute after several missed chances in the first half. The first half of the match had ended goalless with the Golden Eaglets looking more coordinated in defence unlike in their group matches. In the second half, the Fatai Amoo tutored boys dominated the midfield and eventually got the goal.
