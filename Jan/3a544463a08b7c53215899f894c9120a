Dr Isa Pantami, the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy presented the items at the closing of a digital job creation training in Abuja on Wednesday. Pantami said that the gesture was in line with President Muhammadu Buhari’s digital economic drive in the country.

He reaffirmed that the focus of the world had changed from certificates to skills acquisition and advised Nigerians to be patient and ambiguities on digital skill acquisition. “This is a digital training organised by the government under the supervision of the ministry in order to create more job opportunities for our citizens within and outside the country. “This is the third. We are in the pilot phase, trying to validate the model we have developed. “We try to study the existing gaps in the digital world, come up with training to fill the gap. “This is what we have been doing, it is all about creating jobs for our citizens in line with the priority issues of this administration, particularly in the area of economic development,” he said.
