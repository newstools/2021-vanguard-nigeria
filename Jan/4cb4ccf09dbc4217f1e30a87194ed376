The company which provides retirement planning, investment management and pension administration services to over 700,000 working Nigerians and retirees gave this projection in its outlook for the economy titled, “Nigeria 2021 Outlook: A return to normalcy, but tough policy choices lie ahead” While expressing optimism of return to positive economic growth in 2021, the company also projected a return to economic growth, further weakening of the Naira and higher inflation rate in the year, citing weaker oil exports amidst resurgence in import demand, underwhelming 2020 crop harvest, border closures, higher electricity tariffs and petrol prices.

Against this backdrop, we think the current bullish run across fixed income and equity markets will top out in the first half of the year, giving way for the emergence of bearish sentiments over the second half of 2021.” By Pabina Yinkere In line with global trends, Nigeria’s financial markets have been rocked by the COVID-19 outbreak as the All Share Index plunged 20.7 percent in Q1 2020 with deep declines across all sectors.
