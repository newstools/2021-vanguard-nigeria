When I spoke to the manager I knew that I had joined the perfect club,” he said. “I have had time to prepare for this move, both physically and mentally, and I have worked really hard to be ready to make the step up to this amazing club.” Manchester United are second in the league standings, level with leaders Liverpool on 33 points with a game in hand, and host Watford in the FA Cup on Saturday.(Reuters/NAN) Vanguard News Nigeria  The BBC reported that Chelsea had agreed a fee of £21 million (29.8m euros, $32.9m) with the reigning European champions and that the 28-year-old Pedro was on a flight to London to finalise the terms of the transfer.
