We’re seeing a huge rise in COVID-19 scams which can pose a major risk to the security of our local businesses. “That’s why we’re rolling out free cybersecurity training to any organization that wants it. Whether you’re currently a customer or not, we want to make sure employees have some knowledge of how to protect themselves. “Right now, all that matters to us is coming together to protect our community,” he added.

We offer you a long list of features grouped into the following categories: Monetisation, Contact, Customisation, Social Media, Events, Miscellaneous and more. “The third is to customize the way your app looks, add your app icon and publish in Appstore, Google Playstore or create a link for a Progressive Web App (PWA).
