The Office added that “a breakdown of the Agencies and entities responsible for the transactions is included within the report, and audits of the participating agencies remain ongoing at the time of publishing this interim report”.

The report also indicted the Nigerian Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) for failing to keep proper accounts of financial expenses, donations and other activities amounting to N1.6 billion. It stated that: “NCDC paid the sum of N19,257,650.74 to some members of staff for the shipment, clearing and distribution of donations received. The NCDC was unable to account for these items as records showing particulars of donors, nature of items donated, and list of beneficiaries were not presented for audit scrutiny. “It was observed that the sum of N1,147,891,839.87 was spent by the NCDC on the procurement of various goods and services. The procurements were not recorded on the Nigeria Open Contracting Portal (NOCOPO). This is contrary to the procurement guidelines issued by the Bureau for Public Procurement (BPP). “Audit observed that NCDC disbursed a sum of N233,200,000.00 as special allowances to some members of staff from COVID-19 fund without approval of the Head of Service or the National Salaries, Income and Wages Commission. “Examination of financial records of NCDC showed that the sum of N100,001,970.00 was recorded as expenditure on salaries and allowances for ad-hoc staff. It was however observed that NCDC could not substantiate this claim with records detailing names of ad-hoc staff, evidence of engagement/appointment nature of services rendered, and amount paid to each of them. “It was observed that NCDC paid a sum of N118,864,813.20 to some members of staff as cash advances for the procurement of goods and services that should have been procured through proper award of contract. “This procurement method was contrary to Financial Regulation 2302(ii) which requires that “On no account shall cash advances be use in place of Local Purchase Order or Job Order for the procurement of store locally”.
