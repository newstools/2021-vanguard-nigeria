The newly-appointed Coordinator of the Southern and Middle Belt Forum, SMBF, and immediate past President-General of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Chief Nnia Nwodo, has expressed shock and disappointment at President Muhammadu Buhari’s exclusion of Igbo in the appointment of the new Service Chiefs. Nwodo insinuated that Buhari’s action was an obvious expression of disdain for the Igbo people and a statement that suggests that no Igbo is fit to head any Nigerian security agency. President Buhari had, Tuesday, sacked Service Chiefs and immediately replaced them with new ones, which did not include any Igbo man or woman.
