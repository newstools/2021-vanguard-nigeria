The increase in the debt stock by N2.381 trillion or USD6.593 billion was accounted for by the USD3.36 Billion budget support ;oan from the International Monetary Fund, New Domestic Borrowing to finance the Revised 2020 Appropriation Act including the issuance of the N162.557 billion Sukuk, and Promissory Notes issued to settle Claims of Exporters.
