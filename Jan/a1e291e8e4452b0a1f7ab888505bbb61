He also called on the Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN, parastatals in the federal and state civil services not to deal with impersonating elected executives of the association as they are not from the association. He added that the ministry sits will sit and talk about issues affecting the association on the 28th January, 2021 before an election date will be decided and communicated. “An Order of interim injunction restraining the defendants from parading themselves out in the public as National President, Secretary and Treasurer of National Groundnut Producers, Processors Marketers Association of Nigeria respectively pend the hearing and motion of notice,” as the matter was adjourned to the 24th January 2021”, he said. He said the rule of law should be respected and upheld being paramount in the adding value through growth and development of any association, hence should apply in the association. However, he (Foni) disclosed that the authentic date for the election will be announced to members.
