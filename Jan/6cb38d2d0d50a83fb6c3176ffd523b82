The State NMA Chairman, Dr Mannir Bature, disclosed this in a statement in Gusau on Wednesday. Bature said: “The Nigerian Medical Association (NMA) Zamfara State Chapter is deeply alarmed by the magnitude of medical quackery in Zamfara State. “This has caused a lot of avoidable deaths and disability to innocent citizens who fell victim to the criminality. “The illegality continues to thrive in the state owing to the failure of the relevant authourities to prosecute medical quacks and non-regulation and proliferation of illegal hospitals and clinics in the state.” He further said that the investigation conducted by NMA reveals that some doctors are lacking in basic medical knowledge and skills expected of a medical doctor and all effort to get their relevant certificate for scrutiny proved abortive. “Alarmed by this growing danger NMA Zamfara has made adequate plans to partner with relevant stakeholders including the State ministry of health, other health professional associations, and security agencies in the state to ensure effective monitoring and regulation of all health facilities in the state. “Already NMA Zamfara State has constituted Anti Quackery and Monitoring Committee which will be inaugurated in the coming week. “We will also engage in a robust Public Education in order to sensitise the public on the dangers of patronising quacks,” he explained.
