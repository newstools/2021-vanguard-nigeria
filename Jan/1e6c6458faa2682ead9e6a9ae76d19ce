Dayo Joe said that the Minister i”s too big to be involved in such a thing as sponsoring an attack on the commissioner. While describing the disrupted meeting as factional, Dayo said ” it was not an APC meeting. “I just believe those who did it saw it as a factional meeting. It was not an APC meeting. They only camouflaged under the umbrella of APC. This is because some other leaders whom they believe are not loyal to them were not invited to that meeting. “So, it was a factional meeting and, as a result, some people were not happy. That was what happened. ” Alasoadura is not even aware. He was not even around. So, he wouldn’t have been the mastermind of the attack. “And Alasoadura is too big to be attacking Saka. So, these people are only trying to make a mountain out of a molehill. That’s just it. It was not the making of Alasoadura at all. “It is because of what they are doing that people do not like. That is what I perceived resulted in the attack. A lot of leaders were not invited to that meeting.” The convener of the meeting, Eleti said he invited everyone who deserved to be at the meeting. ,Eleti said: “We had sat when these youths came in and drove all of us out. They threatened brimstone and fire. But we left the scene for peace to reign. A former speaker of the State House of Assembly, Kenneth Olawale, said that invitation to the meeting was extended to all party leaders, ward executive members and political appointees in Akure North. Olawale explained that the purpose of the meeting was to deliberate on how to mobilise members towards the coming membership registration and validation exercise. “All of us had converged in the hall. Suddenly, some youths stormed the hall shouting, overturning tables, pushing people, brandishing dangerous weapons and saying the meeting must not hold. “They chased everyone out of the meeting. In the presence of security agents, they were threatening to deal with an officeholder from the local government. Olawale said that ” After leaving the Hall, they still threw stones at us. In the process, a number of the women, who scampered for safety suffered injuries. He added that “This should not happen in Iju again. Please, sir, it is time to forge ahead and work towards making our local government and state become more peaceful.” Vanguard News Nigeria THE show of shame by persons from two states controlled by same ruling political party - the All Progressives Congress, APC -  in the South-West region (Ondo and Osun) in the last few weeks was not only disturbing, unspeakable, but condemnable.
