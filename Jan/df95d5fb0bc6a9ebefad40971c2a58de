South Sudan’s foreign ministry had formally complained to Kenya requesting for special consideration. The director for African affairs in the ministry, Dominic Gum, said those intending to travel to Kenya can now get visas from its embassy in the capital, Juba. “Each visa applicant must have a negative Covid certificate and yellow fever vaccination certificate.
