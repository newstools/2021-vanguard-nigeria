Recounting the loss of the state party Chairman, during the condolence visit at Government House, Uyo, Governor Emmanuel described the late Obong Udo Ekpenyong as an embodiment of peace, humility, loyalty and commitment who sacrificed his all for the growth of PDP.

Emmanuel, Obong Udo Ekpenyong would be remembered for his sterling qualities and dexterity in handling the affairs of the party, regretting that his untimely exit would create a vacuum difficult to fill. Hear him, “We are deeply touched, if I start to talk about our late party Chairman I am sure from now till evening I won’t lack what to say and I will not repeat myself; he was an embodiment of loyalty and commitment in fact when we call him we refer to him as Obong Udo Loyalty Ekpenyong. You don’t tell someone come and trusts me, you earn trust, Udo Ekpenyong earned the trust of so many of us”, he recounted. The Governor prayed God to give the deceased family, his friends, community and political associates the fortitude to bear the irreparable loss. “No amount of crying will bring him back, we must also encourage ourselves in the word of God knowing fully well that if God did not allow it wouldn’t have happened, it means his exit is totally in line with Biblical passage in Job: 14:2 stating that we all have our number of days that we cannot exceed by one day. “So as painful as it may be, it is the Lord who gives and it is the Lord who takes if there is anything that is certain in life it’s death. As far as you are born you must be sure that you will die, but when you’ll die nobody can tell, but I know it is painful to tell someone goodnight when it is broad daylight, it is always a painful departure”, he declared. Governor Emmanuel expressed optimism that God will raise men that will support the ideals and vision of the party to further build and strengthen the South-South region which he opined remains peculiar to the development of the country. He thanked the PDP South-south Zonal party Chieftains for identifying with him and the state chapter of the party at the moment of grief and used the occasion to commiserate with Governor Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta State on the death of his father late Chief Arthur Uzoma Okowa and that of the Majority Leader of the state House of Assembly Tim Kome Owhefere, praying God to give the families fortitude to bear the loss.
