Big respect to them regardless of what the Internet said. I never mentioned, the internet did. Yes, the internet has impacted a lot and I can’t touch them all. The value-added transcends my life and my music. To cut the long story short, the internet is a blessing for the music industry, entertainment industry and mostly a blessing to an independent artist like me. You can promote your music wherever you are without so much stress about travelling or going where you want your music to go. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-1520589" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_7738.jpg?resize=480%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="MTN Next Rated artist, X-Two J addresses unverified stories" width="480" height="600" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_7738-scaled.jpg?resize=240%2C300&amp;ssl=1 240w, https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_7738-scaled.jpg?resize=819%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 819w, https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_7738-scaled.jpg?resize=768%2C960&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_7738-scaled.jpg?resize=1229%2C1536&amp;ssl=1 1229w, https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_7738-scaled.jpg?resize=1638%2C2048&amp;ssl=1 1638w, https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_7738-scaled.jpg?resize=46%2C58&amp;ssl=1 46w, https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_7738-scaled.jpg?resize=155%2C194&amp;ssl=1 155w, https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_7738-scaled.jpg?resize=104%2C130&amp;ssl=1 104w, https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_7738-scaled.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_7738-scaled.jpg?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w, https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_7738-scaled.jpg?w=1920&amp;ssl=1 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" data-recalc-dims="1" /> No collaboration for now with Yemi Alade. However, It feels really great for someone like her to feel my vibe. The reaction got I and her on top 3 Twitter trending chart same day she reacted to my song is something I really appreciate. Sure, something hot coming, no cap. Wow, it’s just a combination of smart hard work on God yeah, promoting myself with the internet. I got a lot of die-hard fans who really like with my music. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-1520588" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_7745.jpg?resize=480%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="MTN Next Rated artist, X-Two J addresses unverified stories" width="480" height="600" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_7745-scaled.jpg?resize=240%2C300&amp;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_7745-scaled.jpg?resize=819%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 819w, https://i0.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_7745-scaled.jpg?resize=768%2C960&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_7745-scaled.jpg?resize=1229%2C1536&amp;ssl=1 1229w, https://i0.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_7745-scaled.jpg?resize=1638%2C2048&amp;ssl=1 1638w, https://i0.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_7745-scaled.jpg?resize=46%2C58&amp;ssl=1 46w, https://i0.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_7745-scaled.jpg?resize=155%2C194&amp;ssl=1 155w, https://i0.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_7745-scaled.jpg?resize=104%2C130&amp;ssl=1 104w, https://i0.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_7745-scaled.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_7745-scaled.jpg?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w, https://i0.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_7745-scaled.jpg?w=1920&amp;ssl=1 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" data-recalc-dims="1" /> I will like to change the mentality of a lot of independent artists, inspiring them to change the way they think, they have to do whatever they can with whatever they have wherever they are. They don’t have to sit and wait until someone signs them on a record deal. I want them to understand that the talent ain’t enough you have to work hard invest in yourself before anyone else and this has nothing to do with believing in yourself and not putting in the energy to your craft. To all my fans just be you, stay you and do you, and no matter what you do in life worldly or Godly be conscious of your spiritual life. #JESUSsaves. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-1520587" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_7735.jpg?resize=480%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="480" height="600" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_7735-scaled.jpg?resize=240%2C300&amp;ssl=1 240w, https://i2.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_7735-scaled.jpg?resize=819%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 819w, https://i2.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_7735-scaled.jpg?resize=768%2C960&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_7735-scaled.jpg?resize=1229%2C1536&amp;ssl=1 1229w, https://i2.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_7735-scaled.jpg?resize=1638%2C2048&amp;ssl=1 1638w, https://i2.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_7735-scaled.jpg?resize=46%2C58&amp;ssl=1 46w, https://i2.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_7735-scaled.jpg?resize=155%2C194&amp;ssl=1 155w, https://i2.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_7735-scaled.jpg?resize=104%2C130&amp;ssl=1 104w, https://i2.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_7735-scaled.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i2.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_7735-scaled.jpg?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w, https://i2.wp.com/www.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_7735-scaled.jpg?w=1920&amp;ssl=1 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" data-recalc-dims="1" /> INSTAGRAM: @xtwoj

Their music inspires me. They are very opinionated, those two icons have always spoken the truth through their music. Their music transcends time and is very relatable, even the next generation will listen to their music and that… May 6, 2019 In "Entertainment" Getting eleven of Nigeria's hip-hop stars under one roof wasn't going to be an easy task. But I thought because they were all under Storm Records management, we could route them in for a photo shoot and feature. How wrong! It was a Herculean task! If it's not South Africa… January 16, 2011 In "Allure"
