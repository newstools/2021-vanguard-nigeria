Meanwhile, as the dust raised from #EndSARS protests gradually settles, more sympathisers are still besieging the Lagos headquarters of NPA to express solidarity with the management over the attack and vandalization of the premises by hoodlums, who masqueraded as protesters. Presenting the items to NPA management, Chairman, Josepdam, Saheed Kuteyi, said NPA has been a good landlord, making it possible for the operators to work under a friendly atmosphere. Kuteyi said: “On behalf of my management and staff, I am here to present these items just to support and commiserate with NPA in respect of what happened during the #EndSARS protests. We have been working together with NPA since 2006 under very conducive atmosphere. This is just a token, and better things are coming in future.” Also, Managing Director, NPA, Hadiza Bala Usman, commended the management of Josepdam, while expressing surprise that anybody could imagine attacking NPA, an organisation that is for the good of the country. Usman who was represented by the Executive Director, Marine and Operations, Onari Brown, said: “On behalf of managing director, we appreciate you for identifying with us in our moment of sorrow and need. In fact, NPA is an organisation that should be protected because government doesn’t give us money in anyway; we rather contribute to government’s purse. We do our corporate social responsibilities. “Somehow, when there is a mob, you cannot tell how it happened. But in a moment like this, when you see people crying when someone passes on, do not just say sorry. Get close to the person and find out the assistance they would need.” By Godwin Oritse ENL Consortium, operator of Terminals C and D of the Lagos Port Complex Apapa, has donated various types of office items including desktop computers, photocopy machines, laser jet printers, and UPS backups to the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA) to cushion the effects of the damage done to… December 9, 2020 In "News" By Godwin Oritse Ports and Terminal Multiservices Limited (PTML), Nigeria's largest roll-on-roll- off (RORO) terminal, has donated a brand new Mitsubishi L200 van to the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA) as part of efforts to cushion the effect of the destruction of its facility by hoodlums who hijacked the recent #EndSARS… November 15, 2020 In "News" By Godwin Oritse CHAIRPERSON, Seaport Terminal Operators Association of Nigeria (STOAN), Princess Vicky Haastrup has condemned the looting and burning of the headquarters building of the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA).
