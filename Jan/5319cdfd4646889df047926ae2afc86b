In a revealing interview with MailOnline, the 21-year-old boxer declared it will be the ‘easiest fight’ of The Gypsy King’s career while claiming Tyson’s former opponent, Deontay Wilder, could also finish AJ. Tommy – who has amassed a 4-0 record at light heavyweight – also disclosed how his own mental health struggles have motivated his burgeoning career and why he disapproves of celebrities becoming boxers. ‘It’s definitely going to be a good fight but I’ve always said, from day one, it will be his easiest fight and I have no doubt about that,’ Tommy said of the legendary Brit vs Brit showdown. ‘Joshua is tailor-made for Tyson, what a great build-up it’s going to be and what a great fight.’ Tyson, 32, battled his way to the summit of the heavyweight division with a rematch TKO victory against Deontay Wilder in February 2020.
