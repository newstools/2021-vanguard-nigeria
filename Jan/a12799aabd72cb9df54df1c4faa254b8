The Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, stated this yesterday while featuring on NTA Good Morning Nigeria programme. He said train users must comply with all COVID-19 protocols from the beginning of every trip to the end. The minister said:  “If we see that we are conveying passengers who have Covid-19 from Lagos to Ibadan and Ibadan to Lagos, we will stop it just like we  threatened to stop the one from Kaduna to Abuja if people don’t comply with COVID -19 protocols. “Don’t forget that on Kaduna-Abuja, we convey 4,000 passengers in a day. Imagine that about 20 per cent have Covid-19, they can transmit COVID-19 to the entire passengers. ‘’The rate of transmission will be high. The same is applicable to Lagos. Everybody must comply with the COVID-19 protocols, wear your masks till the end of the journey.” The minister also added that the $1.6 billion Lagos-Ibadan railway project, which would be completed this month would be inaugurated virtually by  President Muhammadu Buhari.
