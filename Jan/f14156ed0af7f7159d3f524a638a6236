US-based Nigerian vocal powerhouse, Jemiriye Adeniji, has joined the legendary music star, Innocent Idibia (a.k.a. 2Baba), Ayo Makun, Daddy Freeze and a legion of other showbiz heavyweights to appeal to the Instagram Team whilst also rallying the support of other showbiz aficionados to request the return of the page that was once a melting pot for the hottest Nigerian showbiz happenstances. “Understandably, there may have been breaches against Instagram laws, but I am lending my voice to TuBaba’s and those of AY, Daddy Freeze and the rest of my colleagues to ask for the return of that page.
