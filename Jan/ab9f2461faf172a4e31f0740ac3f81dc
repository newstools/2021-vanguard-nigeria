The PPRO said that operatives of the command also arrested another suspect who bought a Lexus 330 salon car in Lagos using fake bank alert. He said based on intelligence the police trailed the car to Uyo through  Abia and arrested the suspect along IBB Way in Uyo. “The Akwa Ibom State Police Command, on Jan. 18, 2021, relying on credible information, that a Lexus 330 salon car was bought with fake bank alert at Festac Town, Lagos State trailed the said car to Uyo via Abia State and in a coordinated operation. “Utilizing the instruments of intelligence-driven policing by the Anti- Cultism Unit of the command, arrested one male suspect, along IBB Road by Ibom Hall, driving the car with a fake number plate; Lagos AKD 230 GQ and recovered the said vehicle. “In another development, on Jan. 17, 2021, Operatives of the same Unit apprehended a POS Operator, male, aged 26, for fraudulently using fake alert to defraud customers,” MacDon said.
